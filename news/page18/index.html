  <h2><a href="/news/2014-08-05-ethercalc">EtherCalc: Online spreadsheets</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-08-05-ethercalc">05 Aug 2014</a>
  
  
  
  
  <p>Today’s release is a pleasant surprise even to us. Last week, a Sandstorm
fan, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JakeWeisz">Jake Weisz</a>, e-mailed me out of the
blue to tell me he had ported <a href="http://ethercalc.net">EtherCalc</a>, an online
collaborative spreadsheet editor, to Sandstorm.</p>

<p>I hadn’t heard of EtherCalc before, but Jake included a link to a spreadsheet
running on our own alpha server, so I was able to try it out immediately, and
I was impressed. Sure enough, it’s a spreadsheet editor, it does the things
you expect spreadsheets to do, it supports real-time collaboration, and it’s
Free Software.</p>

<p><img src="https://sandstorm.io/apps/ethercalc.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>Jake professes to have had no idea what he was doing. “I have never even seen
Node.js before, I don’t even know JavaScript, and I have only a passing
familiarity with using Linux.” Yet, by just following the
<a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm/wiki/Porting-Guide">porting guide</a>,
he managed to port an app. Jake attributes this to EtherCalc’s simple and
elegant design: “The way it was already designed, it was incredibly easy to
port to Sandstorm. I think I changed three or four lines of code tops to
get it working.”</p>

<p>Speaking of EtherCalc’s design, developer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audrey_Tang">Audrey Tang</a>
has written a long and fascinating history of EtherCalc (and its previous
iterations, WikiCalc and SocialCalc) for the book series
<a href="http://aosabook.org/"><em>The Architecture of Open Source Applications</em></a>. These
chapters have also been reproduced on <a href="http://ethercalc.net/">EtherCalc’s web site</a>.
Check it out!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jake’s port is on the Sandstorm app list now. As always, you can
install it on your Sansdtorm server, or <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io">try the demo</a>.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-08-01-mediagoblin">MediaGoblin: Photo sharing and more</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-08-01-mediagoblin">01 Aug 2014</a>
  
  <p>Today we’re releasing a port of yet another crowd-funded open source web app,
<a href="http://mediagoblin.org">MediaGoblin</a>. You can think of MediaGoblin as a
Free Software alternative to Flickr, SoundCloud, YouTube, and others.</p>

<p><img src="https://sandstorm.io/apps/mediagoblin.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>The app is on the app list now – try it on the
<a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io">demo server</a>.</p>

<p>MediaGoblin is our first app to take full advantage of Sandstorm’s new user
identification features. Whenever a request comes in from a user, Sandstorm’s
front-end proxy adds a few headers related to authentication and authorization:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><code>X-Sandstorm-Username</code></strong>: Specifies the user’s display name, e.g.
“Kenton Varda”. This name is not unique nor stable; it is meant only for
displaying to other users.</li>
  <li><strong><code>X-Sandstorm-User-Id</code></strong>: A hex string identifying the user. This ID is both
unique and stable, so it can be used to identify when the same user returns
multiple times.</li>
  <li><strong><code>X-Sandstorm-Permissions</code></strong>: A list of permissions that have been shared with
this user via the Sandstorm sharing interface. An app can define what
permissions are available to share in its package config. However, note that
we have not yet implemented the full sharing UI, so for now the creator of
the app instance is granted all permissions and everyone else is granted
none. It’s up to the app to actually implement this permissions, so for
now you can simply use it to distinguish between the owner and non-owners.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our MediaGoblin port uses these headers to automatically populate MediaGoblin’s
internal user list. This way you get MediaGoblin’s commenting and other
multi-user features without the need to separately log into it.</p>

<p>Note that there are a few things missing from this port, which we plan to fix
in the future:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Currently, under the hood, apps are exposed only at ephemeral
hostnames; the hostname may change every time you use the app. This is
<a href="/news/2014-07-24-tinytinyrss-plus-security-discussion.html">great for security</a>
but means that apps cannot expose APIs, since API clients want
a persistent URL to talk to. Atom feeds are a kind of API. So, for now, we
have disabled Atom feeds in our port. This is unfortunate, as it changes
MediaGoblin from “federated” to “isolated”. That said, enabling APIs is high
on our wish list of features, so expect this to return in the future.</li>
  <li>Related to the above, it’s currently not possible to deep-link into an app,
since it runs in an iframe. So, sending someone an individual photo with
MediaGoblin is hard. We can fix this by automatically passing through any
additional path added to the outer app URL, and creating a
<code>postMessage()</code>-based API for apps to tell the Sandstorm shell what the
current path should be.</li>
  <li>Due to a limitation in our proxy implementation, we currently do not support
very large file uploads. As a result, we had to disable video uploads for now.
We plan to fix this soon.</li>
  <li>Currently, if you wish to share your MediaGoblin content, you must share
the app instance by copy/pasting the URL. When another user visits that URL,
your MediaGoblin server starts up to handle the request. This differs from
Ghost and Hacker CMS which are able to publish web content in such a way that
the server does not need to start up for every visitor, only for the editor.
Unfortunately, this means that a widely-shared MediaGoblin instance may be
expensive as it may have to run frequently; Sandstorm normally tries to cut
costs by only running servers a small fraction of the time. We’d like to
change the app to take advantage of Sandstorm’s web publishing features like
Ghost and Hacker CMS do, so that the server only needs to run when a visitor
posts a comment, uploads media, or otherwise makes a change. However, this
may require some invasive changes to MediaGoblin, so we’ll need to discuss
them with MediaGoblin’s developers.</li>
  <li>MediaGoblin implements a number of permissions which can be granted to users,
such as permissions to comment, upload media, etc.
We eventually want permissions to be set using Sandstorm’s unified sharing
model, but as described above it is not yet complete. So, for the time being,
you have to set users’ permissions inside the MediaGoblin user management
interface.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that said, despite some missing features, Sandstorm is by far the quickest
way to get MediaGoblin up and running. We hope our port allows this great
piece of Free Software to reach a wider audience than it could before.</p>

<p>And if you’d like to see the missing features fixed in the future, be sure

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-07-25-sharelatex">ShareLaTeX: Collaborative scientific typesetting</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/dwrensha">David Renshaw</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-25-sharelatex">25 Jul 2014</a>
  
  <p>Today we are releasing our port of <a href="http://www.sharelatex.com">ShareLaTeX</a>, a real-time collaborative editor for typesetting scientific documents.</p>

<p>You can install it on your Sandstorm server now, or try it on <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io">our demo server</a>.</p>

<p>LaTeX has long been a standard tool in the world of academic publishing, and we think that ShareLaTeX does a great job at making it more accessible and useful.</p>

<p><a href="/news/images/sharelatex-screenshot-big.png"><img src="/news/images/sharelatex-screenshot.png" /></a><br /><span class="caption">Using ShareLaTeX in Sandstorm to typeset <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rjsimmon/">Rob Simmons</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/robsimmons/thesis">PhD thesis</a>.</span></p>

<p>We also think that, as an open source web app, ShareLaTeX makes a fascinating case study.</p>

<p>On the one hand, it’s hard to imagine any of the giant internet corporations ever offering anything like it, as its potential user base is probably not large enough to merit their attention. On the other hand, within its niche ShareLaTeX addresses a very real need – a need that’s certainly large enough to merit the attention of small teams of indie developers.</p>

<p>ShareLaTeX illustrates some of the barriers faced by such developers. Its core functionality consists of an in-browser editor and a server-side compiler, but to be a viable product it has had to do a fair bit more than that. ShareLaTeX also implements a secure login system, an interface for managing multiple projects, and a sharing model. Moreover, there is the question of hosting.</p>

<p>The striking thing about our port of ShareLaTeX is that it simply bypasses this non-core functionality. Sandstorm already handles login, already has a file selection and organization interface for managing multiple projects, and already implements sharing. The main changes we made to the ShareLaTeX code – and we did not in fact change very much at all –  were to remove these features and delegate their responsibilities to Sandstorm instead.</p>

<p>Sandstorm, of course, also resolves the hosting question, making it easy for users to deploy ShareLaTeX to servers they control.</p>

<p>We take all of this as evidence that Sandstorm can eliminate many of the less-interesting and potentially costly parts of developing web apps. We hope that Sandstorm will enable developers to create many more apps like ShareLaTeX, catering to audiences of all sizes.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-07-24-tinytinyrss-plus-security-discussion">We now have an RSS reader; plus let's talk about security</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-24-tinytinyrss-plus-security-discussion">24 Jul 2014</a>
  
  <p>Have you ever wished for an RSS reader that won’t simply <a href="http://reader.google.com">disappear</a> if the developers get tired of it?</p>

<p>Today, we’re releasing our port of <a href="http://tt-rss.org/">TinyTinyRSS</a> to Sandstorm. Go install it on your Sandstorm server now, or <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io">try the Sandstorm demo</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional web apps, Sandstorm apps can never “disappear”, because they run on <em>your</em> server rather than on the developer’s. Even if the developer stops supporting the app, you still have a copy that will keep working.</p>

<p>You might say: “But what about security updates?” Good question! Let’s talk about security.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-if-an-app-has-security-bugs">What happens if an app has security bugs?</h3>

<p>It turns out Sandstorm apps are automatically much more secure than on traditional servers. Much of your security is handled by the platform, without the app’s involvement. In many cases, even an app that has known security flaws is perfectly safe to run in Sandstorm.</p>

<p>For starters, Sandstorm handles login and authentication, so automatically one of the biggest potential vulnerabilities is gone. There is no way someone can exploit a vulnerability in the app to “log in” to your account, and the app never has access to your password or session keys and therefore cannot leak them.</p>

<p>Moreover, attacks in which the attacker “tricks” your browser into performing some action on an app (with your credentials) are largely mitigated as well, because the attacker has no way to know your app’s address. Sandstorm assigns apps to hostnames on a temporary, per-session basis. When you don’t have your app open, it doesn’t even have a hostname. These hostnames are not displayed to the user, and we’re working on a change to make them cryptographically unguessable. If the attacker does not know your app’s hostname, they cannot launch CSRF attacks and many kinds of XSS attacks are thwarted as well.</p>

<p>The only remaining way to attack your app is by getting data into it by some other means. What this means depends on the app.</p>

<p>Imagine a document editor like Etherpad. This app never talks to the outside world at all. The only way an attacker can even talk to it (the first step in exploiting it) is by convincing you to explicitly share the document with them.</p>

<p>For an app like TinyTinyRSS, there’s another opening: the app requests RSS feeds from the internet and parses them. Hypothetically, a bug in the feed parser or in the way feeds are rendered in the UI could make the app vulnerable. In order to exploit such a vulnerability, an attacker would have to trick you into signing up for their malicious RSS feed.</p>

<p>But even in the worst case in these two examples, the damage is small, because Sandstorm itself isolates each app in a separate sandbox. Even if an app is exploited, the attacker only gets access to that app – and only the particular <em>instance</em> of that app.</p>

<p>In the case of Etherpad, we create a separate sandbox for every document. So, if an attacker exploits a document, they only get access to that document. And as mentioned above, there’s no way for an attacker to exploit Etherpad without first receiving a share from the document owner. And if the document has already been shared with the attacker, they already have the whole contents, so what’s left to exploit? They can’t use that exploit to get access to any <em>other</em> document, because each document is in its own sandbox.</p>

<p>In the case of TinyTinyRSS, if an attacker exploited an RSS parsing bug, they might get access to the TinyTinyRSS instance. This means they’d be able to see your other feeds, and could perhaps change your subscriptions. That’s it. For most people this is probably not a big deal. It’s a problem, but it’s nothing like having your password stolen or e-mail erased. And if you actually have a super-secret feed that you want no one to know about, you can protect yourself by having two separate TinyTinyRSS instances: one for your common feeds and one for the sensitive-but-trusted ones. If you accidentally sign up for an evil feed, you’ll probably put it in the first instance, and thus the sensitive instance is still protected. (Again, this is all hypothetical; we know of no such vulnerability.)</p>

<p>This is what we call the “principle of least authority”: Each app only has the “authority” to do its job, and thus a vulnerability in one app can only do as much damage as the app’s authority allows. On traditional desktop systems with no sandboxing, a security bug in one app could completely expose your entire system to hackers. On the web today, a security vulnerability in one app might expose your password, thus giving attackers access to any other app where you use that password. On Sandstorm, a security bug in one app only harms that app and things to which it is connected.</p>

<p>Of course, the above discussion is about apps. A bug in Sandstorm itself could be much more devastating. But that’s a smaller attack surface, and we have multiple security experts working with us. Security bugs are always possible in any code, but the less code you rely on not to have bugs, the less likely it is that one will harm you.</p>

  <h2><a href="/news/2014-07-22-ghost">Ghost Blogging Platform on Sandstorm</a></h2>
  <p class="post-details">By <a href="https://github.com/kentonv">Kenton Varda</a>
    
    - <a href="/news/2014-07-22-ghost">22 Jul 2014</a>
  
  <p>Today we’re releasing a major new app on Sandstorm: Ghost.</p>

<p><a href="http://ghost.org">Ghost</a> is a blogging platform featuring beautiful design, and which was funded by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/johnonolan/ghost-just-a-blogging-platform">its own crowdfunding campaign</a> last year. We’re extremely excited to bring it into the Sandstorm fold, in particular because we’ve been wanting to use it ourselves!</p>

<p>You can use Ghost on Sandstorm to publish a blog to an arbitrary domain. It uses Sandstorm’s <a href="/news/2014-06-04-self-service-web-publishing.html">web publishing features</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a Sandstorm server, go install Ghost from the app list now. Don’t have one? <a href="https://demo.sandstorm.io/demo">Try our demo server.</a></p>
