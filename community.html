    <li><strong>Use & Share Sandstorm</strong>

    <li><strong>Give a Talk</strong>

    <li><strong>Discuss & Answer Questions</strong>
      <p>Development and user help happens on the sandstorm-dev group; join us, listen, and ask questions! Real-time chat happens in IRC (#sandstorm on freenode), with chat archives available too.</p>
    <li><strong>Build Local Community</strong>
      <p>If you're in San Francisco, meet core developers, app authors, and Sandstorm enthusiasts at the Sandstorm SF Bay Area meetup group. If not, create a meetup group near you. The first meeting can be a small group over coffee. Email us to get started.</p>
    <li><strong>Write a Blog Post</strong>
      <p>The world needs people talking about their own self-hosting stories. Write a blog post about something you've done with Sandstorm. We'll Tweet a link and get you some readers! Email us for topic ideas.</p>
  </ul>
  <h2>Help the project</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Package an App</strong>
      <p>Package an open source app that you enjoy running on your own server. The packaging tutorial will get you started. If you get stuck, email us for help or hop on IRC.</p>
    <li><strong>Provide Feedback</strong>
      <p>For the apps you use, think about how they could be better. You can report issues against apps by visiting the Sandstorm app market, clicking on the app, and clicking on the Code link. You can report bugs in Sandstorm itself on our issue tracker.</p>
    <li><strong>Design App Icons</strong>
      <p>Many apps that are being packaged for Sandstorm are in need of logos or icons so they can be displayed in our App Market. If you have design skills and would love to help out an app with graphics, send us an e-mail!</p>
    <li><strong>Usability Test for Sandstorm</strong>
      <p>A usability test is where you ask a friend to try to do something with Sandstorm while you record their screen & face. We'd love your help doing a user test. Read Usability 101 by Jakob Nielsen then email us!</p>
    <li><strong>Read & Improve the Documentation</strong>
      <p>The Sandstorm documentation lives in the main GitHub repository for Sandstorm. Listen to IRC and the dev group, identify a common question, then submit a pull request to the docs!</p>
    <li><strong>Contribute to Core</strong>
      <p>The Sandstorm open source code lives in GitHub. To contribute bug reports, patches, design ideas, documentation, and pull requests check out the GitHub repository!</p>
