<h1>Sandstorm Contributor License Agreements</h1>

<p>To contribute to Sandstorm, you must sign the Contributor License Agreement.
There are two reasons for this:

<ul>
<li>To certify that you have the right to make this contribution &mdash; i.e.,
  that the contribution is yours.
<li>To grant us freedom to use and distribute your contribution under a
  different open source license in the future.  Sorry, but while we understand
  that some contributors will not be comfortable with this, we cannot accept
  contributions that would limit our own ability to change the license on
  Sandstorm as a whole.
</ul>

<p>Our CLA is based on the Apache Foundation's CLA.

<p>Please choose one of the following:

<ul>
<li><a href="individual.html">You, as an individual, own the contribution.</a>
  (In this case, you may sign electronically using the web form OR print the
  agreement and sign physically.)
<li><a href="corporate.html">A corporation (e.g. your employer) owns the
  contribution.</a>  (In this case, you must print the agreement and have it
  signed by an appropriate person.)
</ul>

<p>Completed forms, if signed physically, may be scanned and e-mailed to
<a href="mailto:kenton@sandstorm.io">kenton@sandstorm.io</a> or physically
mailed to:
<p>Kenton Varda<br>
Sandstorm Development Group, Inc.<br>
PO Box 60593<br>
Palo Alto, CA 94306<br>
USA

<p>If you wish to contribute code owned by an individual or entity who has not
agreed to the CLA, that code must be released publicly under a permissive
open source license, and you must include changes with your contribution to
ensure Sandstorm complies with said license (e.g. displaying copyright notices).
Please <a href="mailto:kenton@sandstorm.io">e-mail Kenton</a> to discuss.
