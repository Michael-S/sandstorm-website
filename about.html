  <h1>Sandstorm is on a mission</h1>
  <p>to make open source and indie web applications viable as an ecosystem</p>
</header>

<section class="story">
  <p>Open source web apps exist. If you look hard enough, you can find open source online document editors, RSS readers, and even a few social networks. But even among techies, hardly anyone seems to use these, probably because they all require running your own server, and few people have the time, patience, and expertise for that. And sometimes it’s hard to build a business case around a niche purpose.
      <br>
      <br>
      Little apps written by random authors in their spare time are abundant on desktop and mobile. But on the web, it doesn’t seem to work this way. Any significant service with a server-side component can really only be run by a funded corporation. For open source software to make sense, the user has to be running their own instance. Software-as-a-Service and open source web apps just don’t make sense together: it’s not really open source if you can’t run modified code, and the high barrier to entry shuts out hobby projects or anything unwilling to be monetized.
      <br>
      <br>
      The only solution is to make sure everyone has a server where they can install any software they want. They don’t necessarily have to administer that server – it could be run by a friend, or a service – but each user must be able to install arbitrary software. And that software must be securely sandboxed to prevent buggy or malicious software from harming the rest of the server.
      <br>
      <br>
      Today, Sandstorm makes it possible for even enables non-technical end users to install and run arbitrary software on servers they control. Apps may be downloaded from an app store and installed with one click, like installing apps on your phone. Each app runs in a secure sandbox, where it cannot interfere with other apps without permission.

      <li class="bio-name"><strong>Kenton Varda</strong></li>
      <li class="bio-title">Co-founder</li>
      <p class="bio-text">Kenton is technical lead and co-founder of Sandstorm. He is a hard-core systems hacker with a penchant for solving problems in ways no one else has tried. Kenton has been open sourcing all of his personal projects since high school, from game engines to mod music players to programming languages. From 2005 to 2013, Kenton worked at Google, where he worked on infrastructure for Universal Search as well as sharing and access control for Google Drive, but was best-known for his work on Protocol Buffers. Kenton wrote most of Protocol Buffers v2 and turned it into an open source project, which is now used widely both inside and outside Google. After leaving Google, Kenton developed Cap'n Proto, a successor to Protocol Buffers which is "infinity times faster" and features an object-capability RPC system, which has in turn become the basis of the Sandstorm platform.</p>

      <p class="bio-text">Jade Wang curates geek communities and is a co-founder of Sandstorm. By background, she is a research scientist, having graduated from Stanford with a B.A. in neuroscience, pursued a Ph.D. at Northwestern University, and worked at NASA Ames. Over the past half decade, she co-founded Chez JJ, a network of live-work communities for tech entrepreneurs and geeks of all stripes, and worked for two years as Meteor’s Chief Culture Officer. At Meteor, she focused on highlighting and empowering leadership wherever it appeared in the community, bringing a research mindset to community growth.

      <li class="bio-name"><strong>Jason Paryani</strong></li>
      <li class="bio-title">Software Developer</li>
      <p class="bio-text">Jason Paryani is a software engineer irresistibly drawn to systems topics. This passion led him to Philadelphia-area finance firm Susquehanna International Group, LLP. While at SIG, he worked on the backtesting team where he worked at the intersection of a .Net Windows stack meeting a Python managed Linux high performance cluster. In 2013, he moved to Mountain View to co-found Statsketch, a software startup focused on delivering easy to use data visualization tools for the web. He got to know Kenton when he implemented pycapnp, the Python port of Cap’n Proto.

      <li class="bio-name"><strong>David Renshaw</strong></li>
      <li class="bio-title">Programmer</li>
      <p class="bio-text">David Renshaw is a mathematician turned programmer. As an undergrad at Caltech, he published research in combinatorics, and as a grad student at Carnegie Mellon he developed techniques for building machine-verified proofs of safety properties for aircraft controllers and surgical robots. Some of his side projects have included a framework for crowdsourcing playthroughs of javascript games, and contributions to a Standard ML port of the Box2D physics engine. Prior to joining Sandstorm, he spent two years hunting for vulnerabilities in robotics software at the National Robotics Engineering Center. David is leading development on the Rust and Java implementations of Cap'n Proto.

      <li class="bio-name"><strong>Asheesh Laroia</strong></li>
      <li class="bio-title">Software Engineer</li>
      <p class="bio-text">During college, Asheesh organized the Xbox Linux project’s documentation into a wiki, submitted written testimony for the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s OPG v. Diebold case, revived the Johns Hopkins ACM chapter, and served as web team lead for Students for Free Culture. After graduation, he engineered software Creative Commons and the Participatory Culture Foundation and co-founded OpenHatch, a non-profit that helps people get involved in open source software. In 2011, he co-founded the Boston Python Workshop for women and their friends and delivered a talk at PyCon that triggered the formation of PyLadies. In 2013, he took a one-year vacation from free software-related work to hone his skills as a Security Engineer at Eventbrite. Asheesh is a Developer in Debian and holds a B.A. in cognitive science, with minors in women & gender studies and French literature, and an M.S.E. in computer science.
