  <h2>Features for Organizations</h2>
<ul id="business">
    <li class="on-prem">
      <div class="row">
        <span class="image"></span><div class="content"><h3><strong>On-prem deployment</strong></h3><p>Get the ease-of-use of SaaS while keeping your data in-house. Deploy to physical machines or any private or public cloud.</p></div>

    <li class="global">
      <h3><strong>Global Access Control</strong></h3>

      <h3><strong>Global Audit Logging</strong></h3>
        <p>[maybe someday] Monitor data across your whole organization to keep track of who has accessed what. Not implemented yet, but Sandstorm can do this transparently, without help from the apps.</p></div>

  <h2>Blackrock: Sandstorm at Scale</h2>

  <p>In development. <a href="https://github.com/sandstorm-io/blackrock">See the code &raquo;</a></p>

    <ul id="scale">
      <h3>Blackrock is an alternative back-end for Sandstorm designed for scale. It is the technology we used to run Sandstorm Oasis.</h3>
      <li class="scale-out">
        <h3><strong>Automatic Scale-out</strong></h3>
        <p>Scale out free machines to thousands as your needs grow.</p>
      <li class="failover">
        <h3><strong>Automatic Failover</strong></h3>
        <p>Random hardware failures are invisible to your users.</p>
      <li class="encryption">
        <h3><strong>Automatic Encryption</strong></h3>
        <p>[maybe someday] Sandstorm's fine-grained model makes it possible for the platform to encrypt every grain with a unique key at rest, and to guarantee that the key can only be accessed by those who have been granted permission to that grain -- all completely transparent to the app. We haven't implemented this yet, but our model allows for it.</p>
