  <h3>Ship your code as a Sandstorm app package and your users run the service.</h3>

    <section class="linux">
      <h3><strong>Any Linux stack</strong></h3>
      <p>Sandstorm apps can be written using any tech stack that runs on Linux. Sandstorm apps have been written in PHP, Python, Node.js, Ruby, Java, Go, C++, Rust, and more.</p>
      </section>
    <section class="runtime">
      <h3><strong>Consistent runtime environment</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>You don’t have to support a diverse set of operating systems.</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        If your app works on your local development server, it will work on any Sandstorm server anywhere. Sandstorm packaging tools distribute your dependencies with your app.
        </p>

    <section class="boilerplate">
      <h3><strong>Avoid Boilerplate</strong></h3>
      <p>Common app responsibilities like authentication, authorization, document management, scaling, backups, encryption, and more are handled automatically by the platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don't have to deal with user management</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sandstorm authenticates the user before the request even reach your server.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don’t have to deal with sharing or access control</strong>
        Just define the permissions that apply to your app, and Sandstorm will annotate every request with permissions possessed by the user.
        </p>

    <section class="dev-ops">
      <h3><strong>Dev not ops</strong></h3>
      <p>Spend your time adding features, not fighting fires.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don't have to run servers</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        No carrying a pager. No worrying about securing user data. Just upload your spk to the app market.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don’t have to worry about backups or encryption</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Coming Soon. Sandstorm does that for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don't have to worry about scaling</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Since each instance of your app handles a single document, it need only run on a single machine, and Sandstorm will deal with poorchestrating multiple instances.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>You don’t have to support multiple “documents”</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sandstorm will start a new instance of your app for each one.
      </p>

    <section class="integration">
      <h3><strong>Enterprise integration</strong></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>You don’t have to implement “enterprise” features like audit logging, encryption, LDAP integration, or HIPAA compliance</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sandstorm takes care of that for you.

      <h3><strong>In-app Billing</strong></h3>
      <p>
        <strong>You don't have to deal with payments</strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        Sandstorm implements in-app purchases and deposits the proceeds into your bank account.
