  <h2>Why use Sandstorm?</h2>
  <h3>Your employees deserve flexible online collaboration tools. You deserve the peace of mind that comes from owning your data. With Sandstorm, anyone in your company can install apps and the platform makes sure you don't get hacked.</h3>
  
  <ul>
    <li class="why-onprem">
      <h3><strong>On-prem deployment</strong></h3><p><strong>Run Sandstorm on hardware that you control.</strong>  When you put your data in an app's "cloud," you are trusting other companies with your security. Some have great security teams, but some don't, and it's hard to tell from the outside. Sandstorm lets you keep your data in-house, behind your firewall, where you are in control â€” but without the usual hassle of maintaining your own infrastructure. Installing a new app on Sandstorm is as easy as installing an app on your phone.</p>

    <li class="why-finegrained">
      <h3>Fine-grained isolation</h3><p><strong>Sandstorm isolates every document in its own secure container. </strong>Sandstorm places every document in its own isolated container and enforces access control on that document. That means that most security bugs in apps don't matter, because only people who already had access to a document can attack it. Sandstorm even defends against vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet. <a href="/how-it-works">Learn more about how Sandstorm works</a> and about <a href="https://docs.sandstorm.io/en/latest/using/security-non-events/">known security problems Sandstorm blocked</a>.</p>
