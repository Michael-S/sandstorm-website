    <section class="choose-host">
      <h3><strong>Choose your host</strong></h3>
      <p>
        You decide where your data lives.
        <br>
        <br>
        Don't want to set up a server? Use ours at Sandstorm Oasis, or try one of our hosting partners located all over the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        Want more control? Run your own Sandstorm server on your own hardware. If you like, we'll set you up with free dynamic DNS and HTTPS certificates on a subdomain of Sandcats.io, or if you prefer you can set up Sandstorm on your own domain.
        <br>
        <br>
        If you change your mind later, you can move your apps and data between hosts at any time.

      <h3><strong>Single Sign-on</strong></h3>

    <section class="unified-sharing">
      <h3><strong>Unified sharing access control</strong></h3>

    <section class="powerbox">
      <h3><strong>Connect apps with Powerbox</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Coming Soon. Create a survey form that feeds into a spreadsheet, attach a document to a chat message, or give a scheduling app access to your calendar. All these interactions are handled through Sandstorm's "Powerbox" UI, which lets apps find each other and lets you grant permissions easily and securely.

    <section class="protection">
      <h3><strong>Protection against app bugs</strong></h3>
      <p>
        Sandstorm implement a wide range of measures designed to protect against security bugs in apps. Most bugs that would be serious security problems on other platforms either don't matter at all on Sandstorm or have drastically reduced impact.

    <section class="sandboxing">
      <h3><strong>Sandboxing and confinement</strong></h3>
      <p>
        A Sandstorm app cannot talk to the rest of the world unless you give it permission. That means you can put sensitive secrets in any app and be rest-assured that your data is safe. It also means that apps cannot "phone home" to their developers in order to spy on you.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="auditable">
      <h3><strong>Auditable access</strong></h3>
      <p>
        You can always see who has access to your grains -- including people with whom you shared and other grains to which you connected it -- and you can revoke these connections at any time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="authentic">
      <h3><strong>Authentic apps</strong></h3>
      <p>
        When you install an app on Sandstorm, you can see exactly who created the app package, including such details as their verified Twitter and Github accounts, verified domain names, and their PGP key fingerprint.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="automatic">
      <h3><strong>Automatic, authentic updates</strong></h3>
      <p>Just like your web browser, it's important to keep Sandstorm up-to-date. Self-hosted Sandstorm updates itself automatically in-place with no action needed by you. All updates are cryptographically signed and verified.</p>
