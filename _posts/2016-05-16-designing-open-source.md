We had the pleasure of having designer, developer, and app author [Richard Caceres](https://github.com/rchrd2) speak at our Sandstorm.io [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/229350176/) in San Francisco on March 24, 2016.

In his talk Richard emphasized the value of free and open source software, he shared design principles that app authors should follow (to create a more cohesive user experience across apps), and he also demoed a newly updated version of his TextEditor app.

>"Every app would benefit from allowing you to customize the CSS. I think that's really important. In TextEditor, you can do that now."

<h3>Watch Richard's full talk to hear more about:</h3>

- What makes good free software
- Why you should develop apps for Sandstorm
- The importance of design for apps
- Examples of successful open source design
- Visual guidelines for apps
- New TextEditor features (like customizable CSS)
- And more!
