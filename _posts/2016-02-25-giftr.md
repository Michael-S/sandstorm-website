Giftr is one of the newest additions to our [App Market](https://apps.sandstorm.io/); it helps make coordinating gift exchanges less painful for you and other gifters involved. At our [Sandstorm San Francisco meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/227595644/) in January, app author Andrew Wansley shared his story of how his decision to create & package his [Giftr](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/tr3w5p7ajsf61nf2e6dkfv8tdjes0qsm5w6ew0frd4qwnacwur90) app all started from a simple family tradition.
