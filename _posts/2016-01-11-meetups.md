Here in the San Francisco Bay Area, since May 2015, we've been organizing [monthly Sandstorm meetups](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/) for community members can share their apps, works in progress, and learn from each other.  Recently, Sandstorm community members have stepped up to organize [local Sandstorm meetups](http://sandstorm.meetup.com/) in [New York](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-NY/), [Boston](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-Boston/), [Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-Berlin/), and [Switzerland](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-CH/) as well.
