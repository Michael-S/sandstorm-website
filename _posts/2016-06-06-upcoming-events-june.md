**Designing secure systems with Object-Capabilities, Python, and Cap'n Proto (San Francisco, CA)**

Join us for a talk from Sandstorm core dev [Drew Fisher](https://github.com/zarvox) about an object-oriented programming inspired technique for designing secure systems called object-capability security. Drew's talk will be followed by a Q&A session with opportunities to chat with Sandstorm's community before and after. A huge shoutout and thanks to [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) for hosting the meetup and for dinner!
