This month features a big change: when you delete grains, they are sent to a "Trash" area, where
they are held for 30 days before being deleted permanently. I personally have clicked "Delete" on
the wrong grain by accident, so I'm very happy with the new feature! This way, I can undo it.

Self-hosters will also appreciate the totally-redesigned admin interface. Visit /admin on your server
and you'll see that it's easier to navigate and visually cleaner.

Here's the full changelog. As always, you can visit your Sandstorm server and find the changelog
under the "About Sandstorm" section.

### v0.164 (2016-05-20)
- Self-hosting: The admin settings UI has been completely revamped.
- Fixed grain debug log auto-scrolling.
- Sandcats: Fixed obscure ASN.1 type issue in CSRs that was causing Globalsign API to complain.
- Fixed bug where logging in via Google or Github while viewing a sharing link which you had already redeemed previously would lead to an error.

### v0.163 (2016-05-15) [bugfixes]
- Fixed subtle bug introduced in 0.162 which caused shared grains to refresh every minute.

### v0.162 (2016-05-14)
- Implemented "trash". Deleted grains go to the trash where they can be recovered for up to 30 days.
- Grains can now be deleted from the grain list, without opening them first. Multiple grains can be selected for deletion at once.
- An app can now request that the "who has access" dialog be displayed.
- Fixed bug where after an upload failed, future uploads would show the same error despite not having failed.
- Tweaked the "logout other sessions" button to give better feedback that the request is in-progress.
- When visiting a Sandstorm server that hasn't been set up yet, you'll now be redirected to the setup wizard.
- The API endpoint now allows the authorization token to be specified as part of the path, for cases where setting the `Authorization` header is not possible (especially cross-origin WebSocket).
