In this tutorial, we will show you how a family on holiday can organize images from dad's DSLR, mom's iPhone and the kid's Android phone inside one album. They can all use the same Lychee grain in Sandstorm from a web browser; this tutorial shows how to set it up.

There are at least a couple of different scenarios where you'd want to create a photo library and share it with others. Another example is when 3 people are writing a blog but only one editor approves images, so images need to be collected at a central point. I have found uploading and sharing via Google to be a bit hit and miss.

In any case where you need to create a shared photo library using Lychee, you can follow these steps:

<h3>1. Get Sandstorm by <a href="https://oasis.sandstorm.io/">signing up for Oasis</a> or <a href="https://sandstorm.io/get#self-hosting">installing it on your own machine.</a><h3>

<h3>2. Install Lychee from the <a href="https://apps.sandstorm.io">App Market</a></h3>

<h3>3. In the next window that opens, click: INSTALL</h3>
