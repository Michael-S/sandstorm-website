At our Sandstorm meetup on June 16th, Sandstorm core dev [Drew Fisher](https://github.com/zarvox) talked about an object-oriented programming inspired technique for designing secure systems called object-capability security.

Object-capability security is a technique for designing systems that lets us apply object-oriented design principles to security policies, reducing cognitive overhead and risk of errors that lead to vulnerabilities. In this talk, Drew explains capabilities, how they work, and what cool things they make possible for your systems, with real-world examples from Sandstorm.io.

We also have an upcoming meetup on July 19 where Asheesh is giving a talk entitled, "Web app packaging in Sandstorm: It's not LAMP." RethinkDB is kind enough to host our event at their office in Mountain View, and all are invited. [Read the details & RSVP here](http://www.meetup.com/Sandstorm-SF-Bay-Area/events/231954146/).
